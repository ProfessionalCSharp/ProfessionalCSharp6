# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 20, Diagnostics and Application Insights

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* Simple Event Source Sample (using `EventSource` to write diagnostics)
* EventSourceSampleInheritance (deriving from `EventSource` to write diagnostics)
* EventSourceSampleAnnotations (adding annotations to the custom class derived from `EventSource`)
* MyApplicationEvents (library that writes event information)
* ClientApp (program using MyApplicationEvents with a custom listener for events)

The book chapter also describes the use of Application Insights with a UWP application. You can still use Application Insights as described in the book - but only with Web applications. For client applications, use **HockeyApp** instead.

Check [More Samples](https://github.com/ProfessionalCSharp/MoreSamples "More Samples" for an upcoming sample for HockeyApp.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
* .NET Core 1.0 for Visual Studio

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows).
